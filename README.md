### Employees Eligable to Participate in a Mentorship Program

In order to prepare for the upcoming retirements of many employees, management is interested in starting a mentorship program. As the image below shows, there are a number of employees nearing the retirement age that would be great candidates for the program. Specifically, in the aforementioned roles of 'Senior Engineers' and 'Senior Staff'.

2.

3.

4.

## Summary:

I think the number of employees nearing retirement age should be a focus of upper management. Specifically, for the roles of 'Senior Engineers' and 'Senior Staff'. Management should consider hiring additional employees at slightly lower/equivalent roles to eventually fill those positions. For employees not immeadiatly expected to retire, proposing the mentorship program will provide a smoother transition in the work force as employees retire. 

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- The "Silver Tsunami" should expect 72,458 people to retire soon. 
 -

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
